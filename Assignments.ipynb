    "You are a solutions architect who is working with a customer, a startup travel company, to design solutions on AWS to meet their business needs. The startup has a travel website that helps users search for deals on flights and hotels based on data that the user inputs on the website. Currently, the code for the startup’s application has been written and they want to host a web backend for one of their APIs, which is used for making queries against their data. This web backend must accept requests from external clients that make HTTPS calls. The clients will make GET requests from the frontend. These requests will require complex Structured Query Language (SQL) queries against the data. The customer plans to use a relational database, such as MySQL, to store this data. This customer also wants to use serverless technologies when possible.\n",

    "A three-tier architecture composed of a frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), backend (Apache Web Server and a Java application), and database (MySQL). The three-tier application hosts a dynamic website that accepts user traffic from the internet.\n",

    "A data analytics workload that runs Apache Hadoop. The analytics workload analyzes a massive amount of data that stored on premises and it also uses visualization tools to derive insights.\n",

    "These components are currently running in the data center on physical servers. Currently, if a power outage occurred in the data center, all systems would be brought offline. Because of this issue (in addition to other benefits of the cloud), your customer wants to migrate all components to the cloud and, when possible, use AWS services to replace on-premises components.\n",

    "Do the diagram and the written explanation include the solution for both the three-tier application and the data analytics solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Does the written explanation include a justification for the specific approach they took for the migration? (For example, going cloud native compared to lifting and shifting.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions: You have been tasked with designing a solution that uses AWS services to decouple the application layers (frontend, backend, and database), and that hosts both the application and the data analytics workload in the cloud. You can use managed services and advocate for refactoring the code to take advantage of cloud-native technologies, or you can do a lift and shift and advocate for minimal refactoring. Also, the data analytics solution currently runs on Hadoop and you have a requirement to spin up an Amazon EMR cluster for it. However, it’s up to you to choose which AWS services you want to use for the ingestion, storage, and visualization of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whichever architecture you choose to create, write an explanation that details how the solution works and why you chose to use the services that you selected. Also, create an architecture diagram that depicts how both solutions will be hosted on AWS. \n",
    "\n",
    "Submit both the diagram and your explanation for peer review.\n"
